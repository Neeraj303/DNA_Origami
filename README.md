# DNA_Origami

DNA origami holds a promising role in the field of Nano-technology but have challenge of predicting stability of the structurer. This project would essesntially work as the tutorial/steps to get started with DNA origami structure Atomic-Scale Molecular Dyanmics Study. At the time of starting this project i would specifically lbe ooking for all the relevent documents, tutorials and research articles around using software package NAMD and VMD since due to my previous relevant expericne.
