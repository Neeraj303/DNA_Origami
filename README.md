# DNA_Origami

DNA origami holds a promising role in the field of Nano-technology but have challenge of predicting stability of the structurer. This project would essesntially work as the tutorial/steps to get started with DNA origami structure Atomic-Scale Molecular Dyanmics Study. At the time of starting this project i would specifically lbe ooking for all the relevent documents, tutorials and research articles around using software package NAMD and VMD since due to my previous relevant expericne.

Few good references to get started with MD related to DNA:
1. NAMD DNA case study tutorials: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/CaseStudies/pdfs/dna.pdf 
2. NIST Beginner's guide to DNA origami: https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/01/nist-publishes-beginners-guide-dna-origami 
3. DNA_origami tut by Aksimentiev Group: https://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/tutorials/practical-guide-dna-origami-simulations-using-namd
