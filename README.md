# DNA_Origami

DNA origami holds a promising role in the field of nanotechnology, but predicting the stability of its structures remains a challenge. This project will essentially serve as a tutorial/guide to getting started with an atomic-scale molecular dynamics study of DNA origami structures. Specifically, I'll be looking for relevant documents, tutorials, and research articles on using the software packages NAMD and VMD, based on my previous experience.

Few good references to get started with MD related to DNA:
1. NAMD DNA case study tutorials: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/CaseStudies/pdfs/dna.pdf 
2. NIST Beginner's guide to DNA origami: https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/01/nist-publishes-beginners-guide-dna-origami 
3. DNA_origami tut by Aksimentiev Group: https://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/tutorials/practical-guide-dna-origami-simulations-using-namd
